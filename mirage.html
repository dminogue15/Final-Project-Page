        <p> Mirage is an agile, wind-based Hero with powerful abilities and disruption. By throwing out 
            Fire Scarabs and transforming into a Tornado, Mirage can damage, lift up, and steal life 
            from his targets while applying Djinn's Mark to enemies to enhance his attacks. When the 
            time is right, he can Travel across the map in an instant to assist his allies in escaping 
            or hunting down weak foes. <br>
            An emissary of the Djinn ambassador Nashala Dion, Mirage is a diplomatic bodyguard who is 
            charged with carrying and protecting the djinn's vessel. </p>
