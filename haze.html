        <p> Haze works as a secret agent in the Sandman Division of OSIC, fighting as a devastating 
            assassin character with a specialty in isolating and eliminating her foes. Her Smoke Bomb 
            lets her sneak up on enemies before knocking them out with a Sleep Dagger and unleashing a 
            hail of gunfire at close range. In desperate situations, Haze can enter her Bullet Dance to 
            avoid return fire while dispatching her remaining targets. <br>
            In her position at the Occult Security and Investigation Commission, Haze is regularly 
            tasked with infiltrating the dreams of "Persons of Interest" to determine the threat they 
            pose to the United States. If needed, she will be called upon to terminate those targets 
            that are deemed too dangerous to be left alive. </p>
