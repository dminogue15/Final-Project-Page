        <p> Ivy is a gargoyle-turned-vigilante with potent supportive and disruptive abilities to assist 
            her allies in combat. After linking up with an ally to share healing and buffs, she can summon 
            patches of snarling vines from her Kudzu bomb and transform into a stony gargoyle to damage and 
            stun the enemy while healing herself. With her abilities of flight, she can pick up any ally or 
            bomb and fly them to any point on the battlefield, choosing to either explosively Air Drop them 
            into the middle of the enemy battle group, or rescue an ally from danger. <br>
            Ivy's former life as an inanimate gargoyle ended abruptly when she was summoned to life to 
            protect a girl and her family from The Mendoza Syndicate. Vowing to protect her new family, 
            The Arroyo's, Ivy began a vigilante mission to dismantle the Syndicate. After 18 years of work, 
            she succeeded at defeating the organization, and now searches outside Spanish Harlem to find a 
            new goal to dedicate her life to. </p>
