        <p> Yamato (real name Kaori) is a close-range assassin using precise strikes and sword attacks to 
            destroy her foes. Conducting a Flying Strike with her grapple to get close, Yamato unleashes her 
            powerful melee attacks along with Power Slash and Crimson Slash attacks to damage, slow, and 
            disable her enemies while healing herself. Once fully engaged, she can unleash her Shadow 
            Transformation to become infused with a shadow soul, becoming unstoppable for a short time 
            while ending the life of her opponents. <br>
            Kaori and her brother Yamato were crime lords of the Seventh Moon, bringing in wealth 
            and power to the organization. However, a dispute during expansion led to the death of Kaori's 
            brother and her escape to the United States. A miscommunication once she arrived led to Kaori 
            adopting her brother's name, Yamato, vowing to secure her family's name once again. <br>
            Yamato's gun has an alt-fire mode. </p>
