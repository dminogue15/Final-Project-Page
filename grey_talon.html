        <p> Grey Talon is a clever, long-range combatant that uses his powerful bow in combination with 
            traps and mystical flight to pin down and destroy his foes. With the ability to charge his 
            arrow shot for powerful effect, Grey Talon can harry his foes at a distance before launching a 
            guided Spirit Owl to finish them off. <br>
            A founder of the monster hunting organisation The Baxter Society, Grey Talon happily retired 
            after 40 years of service to support his extended family. He was living well until he was alerted 
            that that his son and daughter-in-law had died in a mysterious house fire. Now, he hunts the 
            perpetrators of the arson, bow in hand.   </p>
