        <p> McGinnis is a playable hero in Deadlock, wielding a machine gun and whose abilities 
            revolve around the usage of structures like turrets and walls she can create to support 
            allies and hold down positions to the benefit of her team and if the situation goes awry, 
            she can launch a powerful barrage of rockets at her enemies. <br>
            A talented engineer who started her career from a young age, McGinnis isn't fond of 
            theoretical work, thus spending most of her time working in a mechanics shop, often meddling 
            with the supernatural. </p>
