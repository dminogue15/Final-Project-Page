        <p> Vindicta is a mobile and powerful marksman, engaging and picking off her targets from a distance. 
            Using her Crow Familiar to initiate fights by bleeding her targets, Vindicta may launch into Flight 
            to keep her distance from enemies and tether them with a Stake in the ground while targeting 
            them with her powerful rifle. Enemies that are near-death should fear her ability to Assassinate 
            at long-range with a devastating sniper shot. <br>
            A witch who was killed by John Hathorne during the Salem Witch Trials of the 1600s, 
            Vindicta returned to this world during the first Maelstrom. Seeking to protect her fellow 
            supernatural entities, Vindicta is waging a war against the Neo-inquisitorial "Friends of Humanity". </p>
