        <p> A modified scrap golem with a big heart and a bigger hook arm, Bebop is a potent threat
            on the battlefield when supported by his team. Not only can he Hook enemies and pull them
            into his allies, Bebop can attach sticky bombs to nearby foes and launch them in any direction
            with a powerful uppercut. For any foes left standing, Bebop's Hyper Beam can cut across the battlefield
            and finish them off. </p>
