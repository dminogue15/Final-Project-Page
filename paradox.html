        <p> Paradox is a time-manipulating Hero with potent disruption and slowing abilities. 
            With a charged Kinetic Carbine, she can threaten her enemies at any range while damaging and 
            slowing them with thrown Pulse Grenades and well-placed Time Walls. At just the right moment, 
            Paradox can activate her Paradoxical Swap to change places with her target, dropping them into 
            a dangerous situation amongst her team. <br>
            Paradox is both the name of this Hero and the name of their Thieves' Guild, specializing in 
            stealing the untouchable and breaking into ultra-secure facilities. Their motives are unclear, 
            except for a certain level of delight that its members seem to take in snubbing the world's 
            biggest corporations and governments. </p>
