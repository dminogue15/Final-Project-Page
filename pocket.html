        <p> Pocket is a spiritual and mobile Hero with a powerful shotgun and highly mobile abilities, 
            who thrives in close encounters. Channelling their magic briefcase to Barrage groups of enemies 
            with spiritual bursts, Pocket may use their sentient cloak to teleport beside their targets 
            and unload their shotgun; disappearing inside their Enchanter's Satchel to avoid return fire. 
            In larger groups, they can unleash an Affliction to slowly eat away at their health, setting 
            their enemies up for a devastating attack. <br>
            The eldest heir to Fairfax Industries, Arin "Pocket" Fairfax has been in hiding for over 
            5 years after a failed assassination attempt. Fearing for their life and wishing to create 
            their own life separate from the company, the newly nicknamed Pocket has been keeping their 
            original identity secret while investigating who had tried to kill them. </p>
