        <p> Abrams is hard-boiled, hard-hitting bruiser of a character that focuses on engaging groups of enemies
            and relying on his high health, high damage output, and life draining ability to stay in the fight.
            With a powerful area stun and a devastating shoulder charge, Abrams can isolate fragile targets from
            the rest of the team and set-up his more damaging allies to finish them off.
            A capable and well-known detective of New York, Abrams solved crimes ranging from kidnappings to ritual murders.
            One day, a mysterious Tome was left on his desk with a note of "Don't let them have it" scrolled in Onyx blood;
            followed by car bombings and break-ins to his office. Now, Abrams is trying to figure out just what the hell
            is going on. </p>
