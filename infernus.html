        <p> Infernus is an Ixian with a powerful control of flame that he uses to enhance his speed 
            and ignite his enemies. Combining his Flame Dash with the ability to spew a napalm Catalyst, 
            Infernus can chase down and ignite his foes with a deadly Afterburn. Any targets left standing 
            will be subject to his explosive Concussive Combustion, knocking them out and leaving them 
            vulnerable to further immolation. <br>
            As a creature from Ixia, Infernus had a troubled and intense youth while he was raised in the 
            United States. Despite a rash of deadly crime as a teenager, he found himself tending a bar in 
            his adulthood and learning to calm his intense emotions. With quality music and interesting people 
            to talk to, Infernus rarely has a need these days to call up his dangerous supernatural abilities. </p>
