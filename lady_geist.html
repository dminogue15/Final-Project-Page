        <p> An old-time socialite with a necromantic pact, Lady Geist is a terrifying foe that consumes 
            her own health for her abilities while draining the life away from enemies. Sacrificing her 
            life force to launch Essence Bombs and blood shards of Malice, Lady Geist can make up the 
            lost health with a Life Drain tether to a nearby opponent. After being brought low by her 
            own abilities or enemy attacks, she can conduct a Soul Exchange and swap health with her 
            opponent, making them vulnerable to followup attacks from her revolver. <br>
            The Toast of the Town, Lady Geist was famed by all and invited to every ball and 
            gala in the city... until her beauty faded in her old age and left her with only 
            memories and stories of her glory. In desperation, she formed a pact with a powerful 
            spirit and bound it by powerful wards until she was safe and young again. All she needs 
            to do now is feed on the life force of her fellows to maintain her beauty... and hope desperately 
            that the Oathkeeper will stay bound. </p>
