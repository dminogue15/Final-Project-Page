        <p> Mo & Krill are together a disruptive and mobile pair that can burrow around the battlefield 
            and leave their enemies in ruins. Beginning encounters with Burrow can let Mo & Krill pop out 
            on unsuspecting enemies, attacking them with Scorn and Sand blast to damage and disarm them. With 
            the support of their team, they can Combo one targeted enemy to pin their target in place while 
            the rest of their allies unleash their attacks. <br>
            Members of The Tunnel Rats, Mo & Krill are smugglers and illicit traders who make the underground 
            of New York their home. Rival gangs that try to exploit these tunnel systems for their own gain 
            will rapidly discover how protective and deadly this pair of smugglers can be. </p>
