        <p> Kelvin is a dedicated, undead scientist with a bevy of freezing abilities to slow his 
            enemies and heal allies. He can conjure an Ice Path under his feet for faster movement 
            for himself and his team, throwing Frost Grenades and firing his Arctic Beam at nearby 
            enemies to set them up for his companions' attacks. Tactical usage of his Frozen Shelter 
            ice dome can protect and heal allies while trapping hapless opponents. <br>
            As an adventuring scientist, Kelvin was particularly excited for rumours of an 8th Astral 
            Gate opening in the Arctic, developing an expedition to hunt for it. However, something went 
            wrong with the expedition, vanishing into the snow and leaving Kelvin's frozen, animate body 
            to be discovered over a year later. </p>
