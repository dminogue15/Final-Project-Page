        <p> Lash is a brutal bruiser of a Hero, eagerly initiating fights and chasing down fleeing opponents. 
            He leaps into combat with his Grappling hook, Flogging his foes with a life-stealing whip and 
            stomping the ground with a Ground Strike that damages multiple targets. If the enemy team groups 
            up, Lash can pick them all up at once and Death Slam them into the ground. <br>
            A champion of an underground fighting arena, Lash has built a reputation as a tough and 
            unsavoury character.  </p>
