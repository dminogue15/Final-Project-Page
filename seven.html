        <p> Seven is a brutal and maniacal killer who takes a particular pleasure in electrocuting 
            his enemies with a variety of abilities. Beginning engagements by stunning a foe with 
            Static Charge, Seven activates a chain lightning Power Surge on his burst-fire rifle and 
            unleashes a Lightning Ball to shock down his opponent quickly. Channeling the spirit of 
            the storm, Seven can begin or end encounters by unleashing his Storm Cloud to electrocute 
            all enemies within range that are not quick enough to escape. <br>
            An escaped death row prisoner, Seven is a deadly serial killer who massacred his former 
            jailers and escaped from the toughest occult prison. Nobody knows exactly what he did 
            before being imprisoned, but many citizens of the world now fear what Seven will do with 
            his new-found freedom. </p>
