        <p> Wraith is a fast-talking and fast-firing combatant with potent offensive abilities and mobility. 
            She can activate her Full Auto to boost her own and allies' fire rate, flinging homing Card Tricks 
            at her targets and Projecting her Mind to teleport either into or out of dangerous fights. 
            Singling out a foe with her Telekinesis to stun and damage them, Wraith can decide who on the 
            enemy team should die first. <br>
            Employing her charisma and strength to run a gambling network, Wraith is a widely-known feature 
            of the criminal underworld of New York City. </p>
