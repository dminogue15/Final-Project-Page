        <p> Professor Dynamo is a man of wit, using his brawns and abilities to provide support 
            to his teammates by healing them, teleporting them with him which grants his allies 
            (and himself) a boost to their firing rate, knocking oponents infront of him into the 
            air or, when the time comes, unleashing a Singularity which damages and pulls in enemies.
            Once just a mere professor for Columbia College, this would change when, letting his excitement 
            get the best of him, he approached a rift in time which reduced his physical body to a small 
            dying star. Although his body may be gone, his spirit and curiosity live on, with the situation 
            only further fueling his desire for knowledge.  </p>
